Lore
Introducing a Fact
One of the basic functions of Lore in Exalted is to allow the player to spice up narrative drama, forward the plot, or become the object of positive Intimacies by demonstrating valuable knowledge. Once per scene, a character with Lore 3+ and a relevant specialty or backstory can attempt to “know” something useful about Creation’s history, geography, cultures, etc.
The player states a fact they would like to introduce. If it is a fact the Storyteller deems admissible, roll the character’s (Intelligence + Lore) against a difficulty set by the Storyteller. Note that the context of this roll is important. A character with Lore 5 may have a background in the subject being discussed, or their Lore 5 may apply little or not at all. (See the description of the Lore skill on p. 153). The Storyteller should increase the difficulty and levy penalties as they see fit; conversely, if a character specializes in a certain subject, the Storyteller may declare success without a roll. In any case, if the roll succeeds, the character may introduce her fact as knowledge she knows or uncovers in the scene, allowing the plot to progress, and perhaps leaving those around her in awe of her acumen.
Storytellers be warned! Facts introduced in this manner must remain internally consistent. Once a character has successfully introduced a fact, that information should not be contradicted; another player cannot then choose to introduce a completely contradictory fact by rolling an even better result. Once a fact about the setting has been introduced, it becomes concrete. Therefore, Storytellers, it is up to you to decide what facts to allow into the game, and to what degree. You might deem a Solar’s “Sidereal Exalted” hypothesis to be more than the character should know, while being more comfortable with a theory that tends toward something more vague, such as speculation about “Exalted conspirators behind the world’s events.” In this case, you should clarify which facts you will allow before the roll is made.
To be clear, no matter how many dice your player is able to roll, and no matter what Charms their character wields, you can always veto knowledge of certain events or the introduction of facts that would ruin your story. If an introduced fact contradicts a canonical fact you’d prefer to keep canonical in your game, contradicts a fact from your personal setting history or a future plot development you’ve yet to reveal to the players, or is something you are undecided or uncertain about, you can veto it. In the former cases, you are upholding the integrity of your story. In the latter, you are allowing yourself time to decide if you want to incorporate an idea that might change your view of that story. You should also veto knowledge of any canonical information you think it would be impossible for the character to know. That said, remember that people take Lore because this is the kind of character they want to play. You don’t have to treat the setting like a piñata, and Lore like a bat that will split its colorful shell and spill all the delicious secrets within, but you should always treat a character’s Lore rating as a chance to make the character look good, and as a chance to make the player feel good.
Challenging a Fact
Similar to the rules that allow the introduction of a fact, a character with a Lore rating of 3+, or Lore 1+ and a relevant specialty, has the potential to notice any information that rings false. A peasant farmer (Lore 1, with a specialty of sowing) could hear a deceitful spirit trying to mislead a Dynast into ruining his crop yield with bad information. Any time the Storyteller introduces suspect information within notice of a character with an appropriate Lore rating, the Storyteller can call for a reflexive (Intelligence + Lore) check to see if the character notices. A single success means that the character notices the falsehood, but not exactly why it is false. If the character is able to, on that same roll, succeed with enough successes to clear the difficulty as if she were introducing a fact, the character can then not only know that the information she’s read or heard is false, but also how it is false.
Unlike introducing a fact, the Storyteller decides exactly what the character is able to discern in this instance. Like introducing a fact, the Storyteller may waive the need for a roll if they feel the character is overqualified for the knowledge in question.
