Sorcerous Motes and the Shape Sorcery Action
When a sorcerer turns her skin to bronze, calls up a fiery kraken from the molten depths of the earth, or bind the greatest demons of Hell, she is not drawing upon her own Essence. Sorcery manipulates the energies of the world around the sorcerer, shaping it into patterns and matrices that achieve her ends. When a sorcerer casts a spell, the motes that power it are not drawn from her own Essence pools. Instead, she must take shape sorcery actions to manipulate the flow of Essence around her and channel sorcerous motes into the casting of the spell.
To take a shape sorcery action, the sorcerer must first declare the spell she is attempting to cast, and then roll (Intelligence + Occult). Each success contributes one sorcerous mote to the casting of the spell. If this is sufficient to meet the spell’s cost, it is cast immediately. If not, the sorcerer must continue focusing Essence into the spell in subsequent rounds. She may choose to take additional shape sorcery actions, rolling and adding successes towards the total, until she has enough to cast the spell. Once she has reached the total, she unleashes it immediately and reflexively.
The shape sorcery action itself is a combat action which cannot be included in a flurry. A sorcerer can pause in the act of gathering sorcerous motes to perform other actions, such as attacking or disengaging from an enemy, but loses three sorcerous motes at the end of every round where no sorcerous motes were gathered. If she uses a ritual that allows her to reflexively gather sorcerous motes for a turn, this counts as if she had used a shape sorcery action— sorcerer-assassins often find such techniques efficacious in their chosen trade, allowing them to fluidly switch between fighting and shaping spells.
If the sorcerer begins casting a different spell from the one she has started shaping, then her current spell is prematurely aborted, and all gathered sorcerous motes disperse and are lost. If she simply stops gathering motes, she will continue losing three sorcerous motes per round until she has none remaining, at which point the spell is lost.
Some spells require an extended period of shaping Essence to cast, generally on the order of hours or longer. Keeping track of the accumulation of sorcerous motes in these cases is less relevant than the time invested in the spell, and so they are simply noted as having a cost of “Ritual.”
