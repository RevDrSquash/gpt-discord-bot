Resolving a Decisive Attack
Decisive attacks carry a penalty if used unsuccessfully— choose your moment to launch decisive attacks carefully! As with a withering attack, you start by selecting which combat Ability your character is attacking with.
Step One: Roll (Dexterity + [relevant combat Ability] + any modifiers) against a difficulty of the target’s Defense. You do not add your weapon’s accuracy to this roll. If the roll fails, and your current Initiative is 1-10, your character loses 2 Initiative. If it’s 11+ and the attack fails, your character loses 3 Initiative.
Step Two: If attack is successful, roll your current Initiative value as a dice pool. The Double 10s rule (p. 183) does not apply to this roll. If your target has Hardness (p. 195) equal to or greater than your damage pool in this step, you inflict no damage but your attack is still considered a success; proceed to Step Four.
Step Three: Count up the successes on the Initiative roll. Apply that many levels of damage to the target’s Health Track. This damage will be bashing or lethal, as determined by the weapon used (see p. 195).
Step Four: If the attack was successful, reset your character’s Initiative value to 3 (also known as “Resetting to base value.”)
